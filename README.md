# SALTE_Unity
This is the VR listening test interface of SALTE framwork.
Built with Unity 2019.2.3f1.

**This part of the framework is still under development.**

**We want your feedback and contribution to the project.**

# Motivation

**1. Building VR listening tests without prior knowledge of VR game engines (e.g. Unity or Unreal)**

**2. Open Source** 

**3. Standardise work-flow**

**4. Share tests and results**

# Demo
**Make sure you have setup your VR headset.**
The interface have been tested with **Oculus Rift** and **Oculus Rift S.** 

**Open demo scene**
1. Download and start the [SALTE renderer](https://github.com/AudioLabYork/SALTE-audio-renderer)
2. Open Unity (make sure it is on Unity 2019.2.3f1)
3. Load the SALTE-VR-interface/Listening_TESTS_VR/Assets/Scenes/**NYC.unity** scene.
4. Press the **start** button in the renderer.
5. Have fun.

**Control**
- You will see a ray cast from the right hand controller.
- Index trigger to “press” any button.
- Move the joystick up or down to adjust the slider.
- More control options will come later.

# Builder (Beta)
**Key features**
1. Create a .JSON that consolidate all the data for the listening test
2. For people who are not familiar with coding or editing .JSON file
3. Drag and drop interface
4. A safer way to create listening test

# Future work 
**1. Video tutorials**
2. Localisation tests 
3. 360 videos playback
4. 6 degrees of freedom (6 DoF)
5. More options for the VR interface and control method

# Sneak peek: Localsation test
- Demoed in the 2019 AES International Conference in Immersive and Interactive audio (March 27-29, 2019) Localisation test with head pointing
- Game like interface (easy to embed into game in the future)
- Competitive gaming experience 
- Researchers can collect participants localisation response and head movement data
